Interrupting our normal broadcast of hot days and even hotter sun, is the weather phenomena known as “seasonal changes in atmospheric circulation and precipitation associated with annual latitudinal oscillation of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) between its limits to the north and south of the equator” or, more commonly, the monsoon.

To continue colloquially, it does in fact rain a whole lot. The puddles aren’t small and splashy, they’re small ponds taking up entire streets allowing no entry or exit. I would know, I had to wade through multiple.

At the beginning of my stay, we were told to bring shoes because parts of the city can be flooded. I doubted that it would, this was a city in a tropical climate. How would they not be prepared for flooding?

Well they are as prepared for floods as Burlington is prepared for snow. Which is not very well.

Walking home from work has turned into a parkour mission, jumping around puddles and desperately trying to not get the wind smacked out of you by the actual wind whipping around.

Locals hide up in buildings, but as an American thinking, “well it’s not a hurricane,” I trudge on with my expedition and wet shoes.

All of the wandering to and from work really is not that bad, it’s only been so bad a couple times that a coworker offers to drive us to the BTS station. Mostly because it was pouring so hard you could barely see the road. We thanked the coworker profusely.

There have only been two times (so far) where the rain has been so bad I got worried about potential death. The first was when some friends and I went to a floating market.

## Klong Lat Mayom Floating Market

The day started with sunny, clear skies (they all start like this, it’s a lie) and my friends and I made the long trek to the (almost) end of the métro line from our humble morning of being at the Grand Palace. Then, after a 20 minute taxi ride, we made it to the Klong Lat Mayom Floating Market.

The market was gorgeously simple. We were pretty far out of the way of normal Bangkok, well my normal Bangkok probably constitutes as “touristy” Bangkok, where it felt like a local place. People at the different stalls were talking back and forth like they see each other all the time, which they probably do.

The market was split between a road, with one side looking more lived in, with smaller stalls and a mostly empty food court. We attempted to get a boat on this side, but they were trying to charge us 200 (baht) a person, which was an outrage since we researched beforehand and knew it should be 100.

Across the street was a structure covering the other half of the market. I say structure, but it was more a collection of metal sheets and tarps.

There, we saw a “touristy” bit, but it wasn’t even that much. Just a couple bags and hats with the market’s name on it, as well as some more expensive looking goods. What caught my eye was a wooden frog, which you could scrape along the back and it made sounds. It is now my most prized possession.

We kept wandering until we found more boat people, and here was where things started to get interesting.

We bought our tickets and got into this small boat. It was just the three of us, two Thai women, and the guy steering the boat. Then we were off.

Leaving the dock, we saw the true length of the market (and it was greater than I expected) while seeing the nature that had been slowly integrating itself with the surrounding area.

The more we traveled, the more I noticed that these houses we passed would fit right in back home. Sure, maybe their lawns were a little too messy for the average HOA, but it felt normal. Nothing like the third world country I had led to believe about Thailand and Southeast Asia.

I’m not saying I thought Thailand was a place that was completely uncivilized, rather in school and travel guides they always say to avoid the out-of-the-way back regions of cities for several reasons. They’re not safe, there’s nothing fun to do, etc.

But being there and looking at it with my eyes, it felt like a normal North American neighborhood but with a canal going straight through it. What made where I lived so much better than a place like this? Why was my country thought as superior, as safer, when everyone I met here was nice and kind?

Is it a difference in how we view the country? Is it the people that told me this viewed these people as less? Is it because they have a smaller economy? The suburbs of Bangkok felt like a normal suburb (just tropical), didn’t these people have normal lives just like me?

As those thoughts mixed in my head, we went past a few abandoned buildings, and I thought of Simon Stålenhag. I was a fan of his work, and how nature would take over buildings, machinery, etc., and make it feel reclaimed by the earth, not humans.

And my head combined those, in the context of retro futurism, to create a new thought: we viewed less ‘modern’ societies as being more primitive, but what if the United States is backwards and the retro futurism shows just how much we have regressed?

There were years of constant growth and exploration fueled by the Space Race, and after we had returned and landed on the planet, people got nostalgic. Things were moving too fast, we were abandoning old technology for newer at lightning speeds. Instead of using something until it broke, we disposed of it and got something new, something ‘better.’

But here in Thailand, I see how they truly use all the parts of nature for their life. It’s not that their houses are run down and “not as fancy,” but rather they are living a simpler life with the “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,” mentality.

That brings another question: do we consider these societies backwards because capitalism has less of an influence and people are not buying the “new” thing, but rather donating and using old things until they break? Are our biases because we were led to believe being disposable is the better alternative than sustainable?

So as I was sitting on the small, rickety boat, I was pondering these thoughts and taking pictures of nature, when suddenly the sky started to cry.

Now, as we have covered in the beginning of this article, when it rains it RAINS.

It took less than three minutes to go from a nice sprinkling to a full downpour. 

I was wearing nice clothes from the Grand Palace earlier, so even though the boat had a covering my skirt was soaked in five minutes flat. For those that don’t know, it does not feel nice to peel a damp skirt off your entire lower body. Rather, it feels quite unpleasant.

Trust me, I tried to hide under the covering and avoid the weather, but there is only so much you can do when you’re speed boating along a small canal in the outskirts of Bangkok. And I did everything to still have my glasses streaked with rain, my outfit soaked, and the cold winds whipping through my hair.

Eventually we made it through the rain back to the dock and almost capsized the boat as we all scrambled to get out of it.

Overall, would not take a speed boat in the rain again. Was actually pretty chill before the rain. That part was nice.

It still was enlightening because my friends and I saw a bit of culture that we had never experienced before (and may never experience again), but it also made us feel like damp cats wandering around, trying to hide from Mother Nature and how cruel she is. Similar to the aftermath of “There Will Come Soft Rains” (Bradbury), except instead of the rains being soft and acidic from the result of a nuclear bomb, we rather faced a storm that tried to obliterate us with its winds. So I guess not that similar but fits the retro futurism theme?

## The BTS Incident

The second time Bangkok tried to actively kill me was after I went to my first Thai-Chinese cemetery.

Now, the first question I get when I make that statement is “... why?”

That automatically lets me know that there is a person without respect and imagination. And also how there is a longer story.

I am not allowed to reveal too much of it, I will just say it’s a game I will be working on and I feel that is satisfactory enough for the moment.

Regardless of how we got here, I still ended up, one Sunday afternoon, at a cemetery.

Teochew Cemetery was a really big place that was for some reason also a park? We (my trusty fellow student and mayhem companion) knew it was the right place after we accidentally walked into a Muslim cemetery a block over. The women there did not appreciate us wearing shorts. We left immediately.

So back to the park-cemetery, we walked in and immediately noticed on the left how some of the graves were being used to denote parking spots? 

Besides for the fact that these people were just using something so historical to know where to park their cars withstanding, we did a quick case study (which would have to be a different blog post) about cemeteries and what we could see with these graves.

The more we walked, the more we realized the whole park was a cemetery, but also a park. Some graves were nice and well maintained, while others looked like they fell apart years ago, and even a couple had holes. Some looked natural, some man made.

And yet, as we were looking at these headstones, people were just playing tennis. Out for an afternoon jog. Playing basketball with friends.

I was astounded to not be phased by the amount of history literally 10 meters away from them. The jogger looked at us as we were examining a broken grave, before turning away and focusing back on jogging.

I suppose if you see it all the time then it looks normal, but I am not sure I would truly ever get over the graves (they were gorgeous).

</p>

We left the park after around 45-50 minutes, since we had to go to another museum.

On the way back I noticed the ten (10!) different bug bites, which is really quite annoying. I suppose it would be less annoying if men looked at me like the bugs do (not in a creepy, blood sucking vampire kind of way but more as in a “wow you are the best thing to ever happen to me in my life” kind of way), but sadly we can never get what we want all of the time. I’ll settle for cool graveyards then, I guess.

The walk back was fine to start off with, we passed through a Muslim neighborhood (which I figured out after all the guys were staring at me!) and then continued on a main road heading to BTS Surasak.

Then, when we were ten minutes away, a drizzle arrived.

I made a joke about how I hoped it would be mild until we got to the station when a clap of thunder hit and the world drenched us. And oh boy.

The wind picked up so much our umbrella attempted to fly into the unknown and it was a battle to stay grounded. Grab/Lineman motorcyclists were hiding in shops, and that’s how you know it was BAD.

The streets were clear from motorcycles, and there were less cars than average.

But we trudged on to make it to the BTS, with our pride and several regrets. And we made it. Climbing up the stairs to a station had never felt so rewarding in my entire life.

But it doesn’t end here.

The train arrives. We get picked up. Sopping wet while everyone else is dry, but you know the world isn’t always fair. We make it to two stations before the train grinds to a halt halfway between Chong Nonsi and Sala Daeng.

And then, we stop.

The rain is still pouring and thundering outside, and now I am stuck dripping wet in a stationary train that plays an announcement “sorry for irregular train movement” every minute.

The first few minutes I figured we were waiting for the next train to leave the following station but as we stayed and were more stuck, I was slowly questioning my life choices that brought me to be here, in Bangkok, on a malfunctioning train.

I have to admit, I questioned the feebleness of my life and confessed to myself that I really did not want to die on any form of large transportation system. So this would simply not do.

It didn’t seem like we were going anywhere after ten minutes, and by then I was not only sopping wet, but freezing cold from the cranked AC. Go figure.

We waited for around fifteen minutes before the train started to move and I cheered internally that I would not die on a large transportation system and the world wasn’t trying to spite me for checking out a cemetery similar to how birds flirt with potential mates.

We made it to Sala Daeng and you could see the wind move the trees with such power, like how the trees were paying penance to Mother Nature’s will. It made me awestruck for the power the world had around me, and how those trees were actually really quite skinny.

Maybe we should take earthquake advice from palm trees.

After that, we proceeded on the train smoothly to our destination. 15 minutes late, soaking wet, but there nevertheless. Huzzah.

## Winds of Terror

I will say I never truly understood the power of the monsoon season until I almost got killed by it. Alright that might be a little dramatic, but it almost happened twice in one week so I think I am allowed to be a bit dramatic.

I find it crazy now that people joke about the rainy season, like it is not a joke. You will die. Those winds stop for no one.

I may not be prepared for the heat in Bangkok (let’s face it, I am not), but I am also not prepared for the cold, rainy weather either. Joys.

I guess the moral of the story is to take weather more seriously, especially if you are like me and come from a nice temperate climate. I suppose I can be generous with my lack of a frame of reference, but still should have believed news sources and followed weather guidelines more firmly.

Oh, and bring an extra umbrella. One of my friend’s broke after ten minutes.
