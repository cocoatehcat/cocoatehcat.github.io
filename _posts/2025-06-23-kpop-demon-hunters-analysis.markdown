Hello once again, and welcome back to the blog (I swear I will get better at intros). This week’s goal is one full (work) week of posts, so *let’s see how far we get.* 

## The Setting
Starting off with a new film I consumed and a bit of commentary, I want to make it 1,000% clear I am not a K-POP fan. I cannot tell the difference between Blackpink and TWICE. I only know they exist because I go to nerd school, otherwise I would probably be in the dark about that too.

I try to consume different types of media from people with different cultural backgrounds to further extend my knowledge about diverse experiences. I do not know any significant amount of Korean folklore other than some basics and I am not Korean. Therefore I will be lacking to comment on the mythos and just on the basic plotline and my overall reviews as well as light analysis.
Let’s Dance!
I won’t be writing the entire plot out (go read a summary) but I have to say I liked this movie more than I originally thought I would. I got a recommendation from one of my friends to watch it, and I have been on a bit of an Asian film kick since arriving in Thailand, so I decided to sit down and watch it.

I was not sure how I was going to meaningfully interact with the media, since I lack almost any interest in K-POP, but I found the show to be engaging and quite amusing. The characters felt realistically cartoonish, if that is even a real expression. I felt real emotions and fears portrayed from the characters, while they also did amusing anime-style cartoony things.

The main character, Rumi, had an interesting internal battle, one that I have named, “where does my demon end and where do I begin?” The story felt a bit of a bildungsroman in that sense, these characters were set to be high school or college aged, so coming to terms with who you are and how your childhood screwed you up can hit one in the feels.

The mythology was nicely included, with the allusions to how demons were not just magical, but also part of one’s self. This is not the traditional Eastern messages that stories normally tell. 

## Hidden Patterns
The movie plot was originally created by a Korean-Canadian, about her fond memories growing up with the first wave of modern K-POP. This is a direct departure of traditional Eastern style media, which included a more Westernized approach to popular culture.

The message of, “If you love yourself then everything will be alright,” is a very American sentiment. But, the characters were created to look and behave very Korean. There is a mix between these two parts, one would probably differentiate them as “Western” and “Eastern” instead of “American” and “Korean,” but the messages are still the same.

The film challenges how Western people, specifically Americans because Netflix is an American company, see East Asian, specifically South Korean culture because of the complex relationship K-POP has in Korean society.

## The Reveal
There is a Western approach to the music, which on the surface seems traditionally Korean, as it is K-POP but K-POP traditionally has its roots in Western expression. Korean musicians would take influence from Western styles, like rock and R&B, and incorporate it into their music.

Including K-POP, which is exuberantly Korean to the average viewer, with traditional stories embeds catchy tunes into a wonderfully animated motion picture.

However, there is a Western cloud that hangs over the movie regardless of how “traditional” the film is. The characters reach a Western resolution (we love ourselves with the Power of Friendship) instead of a more traditional Eastern “life is changed and goes on.”

This makes it more palatable to the average Westerner (American in this case) by including plotlines and story elements that are recognizable and familiar. It does not exactly take away from the Asian messaging, in fact it enhances it in a way that reaches a larger audience, but it is something to think about when examining this show critically.

Many Westerners like K-POP, and this might be a bridge between the fandom in music and the fandom in movies for some people. However, I argue it accentuates how Americans think about Korean culture in a more stereotypical way by using more of a Western plotline.

## Confronting the Demons…
One thing I noticed is we did not get a lot of family time in the film. Korean (and Asian films in general) often include family as that is really important in those cultures. There was a huge plotline about Rumi’s mother, but we only got a few minutes of screen time talking about it.

The fact that there was more about the potentially “he’s kinda creepy cause he’s 400 years old” love interest than the relationship with Rumi’s adoptive family steers away from traditional values.

The film focused more on action and plot development and less on that and how the mythology was traditionally rooted in the culture.

I also feel there was not a lot of character development from Mira and Zoey, when they were presented to be two extremely important characters.

The former had family issues, which is extremely important as it clearly affected her relationship with the group and how she viewed herself. That, expanded upon, could have added so much more depth to the story and made the lead trio be stronger.

The former had a people pleasing issue, which affected how she interacted with the other members of the group as well. This could have been expanded upon and used more for the show than, “wow this guy is hot! Oops sorry, demon slaying time!” More of her actions could have been swayed by the two other extremely decisive main characters, and that could have ricocheted throughout the group.

These complex emotions could have affected the story in such a positive way, but they were left without expansion which limited the relationships and their affectnesses to the overall plot line, which could have made the story more compelling and the characters more alive.

And for a song choice, it was extremely obvious they were building up into “Oh we can’t choose a song about hate, only love!” feeds into the Westernization point, but I thought it was important enough to clearly state.

## Ending in Sparkles
All in all, the visuals were stunning but since I am not an artist, I will talk about the story (which I am qualified to analyze) instead. The plot was quite cute and really showed a touching story about accepting yourself, but for me I would have liked a bit more worldbuilding with the family and more deuteragonist development to fully round out the story.

This is probably the first Netflix movie where I have ever wanted a short season of because I feel there was too much world development and not enough time to fully explore this all. Now, according to Tolkien, this is a good trait to have in the world because it makes the world seem full, but I felt some quintessential parts of the story (like the family relationship) were cut out when they would have been helpful.

Moral of the story is, don’t look for your dad, kids. Or at least, that’s what this story seems to say but I like the feminism part of it. It does add a whole point of, “how do demons have kids? Why did her mom love a demon?” but I think those questions are acceptable to be thought over and conspiracy theory-ed for.

I doubt there will be another film unless this one does inexplicably well (which it might, not hating over here), but I think another one could, maybe a prequel, tie up the loose ends with her parents and flesh out the world with some fun Easter Eggs.

The show is a fantastic bridge for what it is for, connecting Western K-POP listeners with Eastern culture, and although there are some points I would like to be highlighted or expanded, *KPOP Demon Hunters* does a great job at getting an American audience initially interested to dive deeper into a complex, different culture.
