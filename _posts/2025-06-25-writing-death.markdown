One of the things that is important to me as a writer is consuming long form, thoughtful content that really makes one as a reader examine and think critically. However, as life grows and technology matures, writing is becoming a dying art.

Some would not consider writing an art, and to that I refute that music is an art. Poetry is song lyrics. Poetry is writing. Therefore, [writing is an art](https://www.clrn.org/is-writing-an-art/). To string words together thoughtfully, to make comprehensible sounds where in other worlds it would be complete nonsense?

Art.

But with the rise of social media and other short form content, [writing needs to be shorter, and less ornate](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/are-attention-spans-really-collapsing-data-shows-uk-public-are-worried-but-also-see-benefits-from-technology). One of the things I was taught when writing articles is to [never make a paragraph longer than 3 sentences](https://blog.hootsuite.com/writing-for-social-media/). No one wants to read a wall of text.

But I grew up with Tolkien and [Paolini](https://www.paolini.net/). Paragraphs could take up a full page. And that was only a middle length one.

Yet I feel confined to this system, where I have to write less to tell more or else my writing is avoided. Since content and explanations are redundant apparently.

Not only does social media prevail with things being shorter and shorter, there is the rise of AI, [causing authors to actually write less](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/30/1246686825/authors-using-ai-artificial-intelligence-to-write).

Now you can populate an essay about why the sky is blue in about 2 minutes instead of taking an hour to find sources, create an outline, and then write the darn thing.

For me, that personally takes the fun away. Reading articles and finding interesting points to comment on solidifies to me why this profession is so important, but for other people it is boring.

Which strikes me as crazy.

My ‘unhinged’ theory is that in the United States we are focused more on an output based society, [which is memorizing topics and regurgitating silly facts instead of actually drawing connections between the material](https://qz.com/1314814/universal-education-was-first-promoted-by-industrialists-who-wanted-docile-factory-workers). That way, people are more focused on sight reading instead of doing complex thinking about the text.

Think of the whole “[maybe the curtains are just blue!](https://timothyscottcurrey.com/timothy-s-currey-blog/2022/3/10/were-the-curtains-really-just-blue)” debate. No, they are probably not. Authors used to have a limited number of words/space to decree a point because paper was (and still is) expensive. To take up space with “blue” signifies importance. Think of [Chekhov’s gun](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Chekhovs-gun). The advice is still important.

Paolini might explain the dwarf civilization for a few too many pages, but it gives you a deep respect and appreciation for this culture and the important dwarves have in [the Inheritance Cycle](https://www.paolini.net/biographies/christopher-paolini-full/inheritance-cycle/).

However, a normal “US educated” reader would get bored because… where is the action! Where is the three second punchline to conclude my five second video!

Personally, we need to focus on a society of having quality outputs, and not a quantity of outputs. But the government did this to themselves.

Quantity was emphasized to [get people ready for factory jobs](https://hackeducation.com/2015/04/25/factory-model). But we do not live in a factory based society anymore. Shouldn’t we focus on quality education and creating the next great minds, not an outdated system that has been proven to not be the most effective, especially for different types of learners?

That way those that want to write (hi that’s me) can write and read the pages of words that I want, while others can take a more hands on approach to learning. All in all, we are not learning to work in factories, but to succeed for life.

[Using AI for all essays and writing prompts only hurts the user](https://sc.edu/uofsc/posts/2024/02/conversation-ai-help.php). To learn is to do. AI doesn’t need to learn from you using it. They have people at large technology companies testing and training and refining each day.

Watching only short form media doesn’t teach you anything either. I can count on one hand the extremely influential life lessons I learned from social media, but I would have to write a book to explain the books I learned from.

Short form content does not have enough time to teach something extremely impactful, only show fun facts. Which can be cool, but at the end of the day it has been shown to [be bad for your brain and decrease your attention span](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/380348721_Examining_the_Influence_of_Short_Videos_on_Attention_Span_and_its_Relationship_with_Academic_Performance).

So that is why I am making a conscious effort to put down my phone and look around outside. It’s not that hard, as I am interning in Bangkok, which is a gorgeous, eventful city.

But for everyday life? I think it’s possible too.

Putting down the phone while walking to work? I always find that there are new buildings, new posters, new everything that I can see just from a short walk. Imagine if the world was disconnected and everyone could see the beauty that is life?

I feel we are too connected to short form content, we get instant gratification too easily. We are too dependent on a little piece of rare metals. [Most people cannot imagine how to live without it. I think we should challenge that mentality](https://www.techtimes.com/articles/295021/20230811/is-it-possible-to-live-without-smartphone-2023.htm). Who are we without technology? How do we interact with a world without screens?

And that has us return to the writing debate. Is writing an art? Most people read online, with ebooks. I only know a handful of friends that read physical books frequently.

If we are off our phones, [how else will we consume types of media like writing](https://www.statista.com/topics/11059/media-usage-worldwide/#topicOverview)? Where does the line exist between short and long form content? How do we dictate what falls in each, and what is important to learn and study?

[Writing is dying](https://guilford.ces.ncsu.edu/2025/04/is-writing-dead/), enough said. But I don’t think it’s a hopeless descent. There are communities to encourage writing, encourage thought, and connection. There are ways we can keep this “archaic” form of communication alive.

Because, without writing, without words, how are we any different from the rest of the animals on this planet?
