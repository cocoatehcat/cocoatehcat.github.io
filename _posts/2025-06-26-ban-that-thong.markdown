I suppose the most notable part about living thousands of every unit of measurement away from home is the fact you are away from home. And you forget about home.

Not saying I don’t miss my family and friends back there, but there is so much life, so much *wonder* happening here that I don’t have time to reminisce as often as 
I would want.

I’m in a true city that never sleeps, and since I want to maintain a semblance of a sleep schedule, that means the hours of time difference, the wondering if they got my message, the apathy.

And then sometimes I am so wrapped up in what my life is here, I forget to check in back home.

Like yesterday I explored the neighborhood of Ban That Thong. It was stunning. Lights hanging from the buildings, food everywhere. I could smell everything and how wonderful it would taste. Pride flags hung, their boldness said and not forgotten.

The neighborhood is near National Stadium, the end of the Silom line and also a place where there is… wait for it… the National Stadium and athletics department.

Also important to note, there is a mall the size of a city block. I would know. I almost got lost wandering in it, trying to find the BTS station.

Regardless, my professors asked to see me and a classmate, one last dinner before they left to continue on their journey around east Asia. It was really quite an honor to be invited out, and I made sure to see everything.

We wandered around the neighborhood, looking at all the different buildings with the distinct architecture. The other student and I were given advice on a restaurant to try, we told them to take pictures at the World Expo.

It is strange to be in a class with someone all semester (for two semesters, actually) and then be sharing a meal with them at a random restaurant on a street corner in Bangkok (we did talk about power dynamics during dessert).

And speaking of dessert, we went to a famous ice cream place and I got a milkshake (see below) and it was a nice night talking about life, how men are easily intimidated, and why we love strong women.

And it didn’t hit me until I was home and opened my phone that friends had texted me. That I had a different life outside the world of Bangkok. Ban That Thong was beautiful (a little bit commercialized), and it felt like a dream to be wandering around a place that was so inferentially cultural.

At my apartment, it just felt like a normal apartment. You could notice the Asian influences for sure, the furniture was a little shorter than I was used to, there was a balcony with my washer. My shower did not have a fan, instead you opened a window to let the steam come out, we had no oven because it’s already hot! Why do you have to make it more so?

But I made the place feel like me, there was a card from one of my friends, my kettle I bought for tea, my desk with my laptop, my hair stuff on my dresser.

It clicked in my brain that a month had almost passed. And as I sat in my just cold room (22 Celcius) I wondered how much of me was going to be different when I went back to the States. Where my friends and family have not changed, but I have seen an entirely different part of the world. Have lived a different life.

I wasn’t quite sure how to feel about this.

Ban That Thong was such a cool place to visit, but none of my home friends were ever going to get that experience. You only experience Bangkok in your teens once. And most of my friends were already 20.

I am not really sure what the point of this essay is. Normally my personal format requires each essay to have a message that it is trying to convey, something important and worthwhile to share. But this one is more of an observation of the inevitable.

I suppose people are right about journaling (if one could call this that). One thing it does is make me want to be a better person, and think more about not just my friends back home, but everyone. Another thing is it makes me realize how many thoughts are in my head, and how many seem extraneous.

That might be a me problem though.

Moral of this essay (as I make one up on the spot): cherish all memories. You never know when you’ll experience something like that ever again. And you never get to be 19 a second time.
