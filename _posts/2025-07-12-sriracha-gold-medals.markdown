I suppose one of the things I never knew/realized until I got to Thailand is the fact that Thailand is the birthplace of Sriracha. And I only realized that because of the fact that the town next to the zoo is named “Si Racha.”

No matter how we got there, one random Thursday afternoon involved me and a friend in front of a building that didn’t look like a store, but it’s where Google Maps said there was the original Sriracha store and we already walked by it twice. The original store was in Si Racha, but this was the oldest one in Bangkok.

We stood there for a moment, not knowing which door to walk into since there were two when a man beckoned us in and showed us to this little worn shelf that had sriracha bottles.

The rest of the store looked like it was either a: falling apart or b: the back of an extremely messy Goodwill, but since the labels on the bottles appeared right, we stepped in and looked around.

The shopkeeper offered us the chance to taste the wares, so we both got a spoonful of mild sriracha. And I have to say, this sriracha was like nothing I have ever experienced before, and it inspired me to write a haiku.

> *Oh how it burns, yet*
> *once your tongue is back alive,*
> *soft sweetness prevails.*

We left with several bottles.

As I held mine on the walk back, I wondered once more how much more history there was, and how many other foods I never knew originated in Thailand. For example, these labels had the same design since their creation in 1932. What else was I missing?
