Now, I would like to begin with the fact that I am not the most athletic person, but I still try to be active in my daily life. That being said, I often have more stamina than my friends and the people around me.

I think part of it comes from the fact that I’m not just a double major, I’m not just a woman in STEM, I’m not just a martial artist, I’m a person who will actively push myself to my brink and I only ever stop for like water. Yep, just water.

Now other people, namely most of my friends, developed this pesky (but unfortunately healthy) habit called “resting so there is no burn out.” Burn out and I are good friends and get coffee on the weekends. The sad part is, I don’t like coffee.

But that is how I ended up at the Anusarn Night Market in Chiang Mai, which was luckily right next to our hotel, alone.

My friends went back to the hotel and all I had was my bag and me, wandering around the city.

Now, my friends at first were worried about me wandering around a city at night being a woman, but since I was just going to be in the market (and they both really wanted to go home) I got the key and was standing at the edge of something… well maybe greater? I wasn’t sure.

I’ve been alone before, I’ve had to face demons and homework assignments without anyone, but I’ve never been this alone in Thailand yet.

Like yes, I have my own apartment (and I like being able to keep it neat and tidy without other influences) but I see my friends everyday and at least one person wanders with me to go to some activity.

I’ve walked home from work but that’s only being on a train and then walking 10 minutes to the apartment, not really alone since I was following a routine that has been set for my body. It was at least memorable, comfortable.

But now here I was, at a night market, with no one. All I knew was my few Thai phrases and woman-in-STEM audacity. Hopefully I would be fine?

And I was. Strangely enough.

I’ve been in long term relationships (which mostly had a record of crashing and burning) for over the past two plus years, so it was another experience that reminded me how lonely life can be sometimes.

And it truly is. I walked through aisles of stalls with no place to go, just my steps and thoughts. Some vendors said hi and tried to get me to buy things (this one guy tried to sell me silk that had a tag saying 100% polyester) or would smile.

I’ve been in Thailand long enough to know what was handmade and what was mass produced, so I got my mom a bookmark from a store that was clearly handmade. It was so interesting learning that I was getting to understand some of the cultural nuances from my time here. I suppose I was getting street smarts!

But as I’m walking I’m seeing couples or family having a good time on a night out. And I clearly don’t have that.

I’m not entirely certain what I was expecting from going out by myself? I suppose just a wander. I’m lucky to have found that bookmark, but I wasn’t planning on getting anything.

Somehow the world feels so alive, like it is bursting at the seams, but other times it feels suffocating to be surrounded by life.

At the end of my walk, right before I was about to leave, I stumbled across a trio of women performing a traditional Thai dance. I stopped for a moment and watched, their movements so fluid and graceful. They were beautiful.

And I wondered to myself, how much of the world do I miss because I don’t want to be alone? How much of the world do I miss because I am with someone? How do people change my path and perspective of an area?

Eventually I continued onwards and walked back home, thinking about past mistakes (men) and future opportunities. Clearly I haven’t found my person as I am walking through a night market alone, but I think that’s alright. 

I feel like I would have seen a different part of the market or had a different experience from being there with someone, and I was grateful to just have me and my thoughts.

Now, as I am writing this, the other members of my hotel rooms are on their phones, absorbed in a world that can be crueler than our own. They aren’t alone. They have someone else’s thoughts, and have had them throughout this whole time, someone else to listen to and communicate with, even if it is just digitally.

And I think about the bookmark for my mom, something meant for something alone and physical, and I think about how we are all so connected, yet all so far apart.

I think more people are afraid of being alone than they’ll admit, than they will even realize. And that makes sense from an evolutionary standpoint. We had to protect our hunter-gatherer societies. However, we have invented agriculture and things have changed.

As I wrap up my thoughts, there is definitely a certain power in being alone and realizing that everything is alright. I want to embrace more of that.

I suppose it is true that you can never figure out who you truly are if you are surrounded by others’ thoughts. The true discovery happens from being completely and utterly alone.
