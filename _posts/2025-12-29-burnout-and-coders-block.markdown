I’ll admit it, or else no one else will, I think I am definitely experiencing some symptoms of burnout. From my (admittedly brief) research on the subject and the acknowledgement of my feelings, I think it’s true to name words to the situation and talk about it.

## A Short Reflection

I am one of those people who keep working against all odds and continue to do more and say yes to more even when it is a bad decision on my part. There are only so many burners on a stove, and once they are all filled, lighting real fires to keep cooking isn’t the… safest alternative.

How I grew up made me a person that takes on more than I can chew and learn how to live with it during the expedition. However, I think that is slowly wearing me down more and more each time, to the point where work I like to do and needs to get done isn’t even looked at and my screentime is going up and breaking new heights.

On one hand, I am reading more books and learning more about cooking, on the other hand my code looks at me longingly like a neglected child.

And one of the things I kept pointing out to myself this semester is, you like to code! Why is this so hard?, when the hard part was my brain does not know how to rest, I only work properly off pure adrenaline, and sleep feels like a distant fever dream.

I’m lucky that I reflected and looked at myself critically, because how else would I know that I was a) not sleeping enough, b) not eating enough, and c) not acknowledging the need for breaks.

Programming in general has never been my strongest point, and I fight my brain and imposture syndrome most days, but I think I have developed a (mostly) put together solution.

From my research, [burnout seems to be caused by doing stressful behaviors unsustainably](https://mhanational.org/resources/burnout-signs-causes-recover/). So, the only way to move on and not get burned out again is to make an active change in those behaviors.

For me, I think that particularly I am going to work on the mental block I have around coding, and turn that into a strength of resourcefulness.

## My (Brief) Writer’s Block Experience

Once, I was asked by an artist how I avoid burnout. I told him the truth: I don’t, I didn’t, and I probably never will. However, I am rethinking the last statement.

I have never received [“writer’s block”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writer%27s_block) in a traditional sense, but I am starting to realize that it still affects me like everyone else.

Normally I can write and create once my brain has an idea, and I have done countless exercises to keep writing even if the material is terrible, and to go back and edit again later. It’s what I was taught and realised worked for me, thus what I practice.

So I never struggled with writing words, and often I have to write a little bit every day or else I cannot get into the mindset to do work. Writing, even if it is just nonsense, helps my brain organize my thoughts and realize that it is time to get cooking.

However I am just starting to realize how great of an iceberg my coder’s block goes.

## Introducing... Coder’s Block

[Coder’s block](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-beat-coders-block-and-stay-productive/) (otherwise known as “programmer’s block”) is not a term I’ve invented, but not something that I realized affected others until just a few weeks ago.

It’s similar to writer’s block, but instead of not being able to write or only writing what the author perceives as “terrible work,” coder’s block is the same with code. It can be only writing [code that doesn’t work and seems absolutely terrible](https://expertbeacon.com/how-to-beat-coders-block-seven-battle-tested-tips-for-peak-developer-productivity/) or [not being able to write anything at all](https://simpleprogrammer.com/overcoming-programmers-block/).

Similar to writing, it can come about from feelings of imposture syndrome (like what yours truly has) or from not understanding syntax or different concepts. This means that they have similar ways to solve problems, like [taking breaks](https://thelinuxcode.com/how-to-beat-coders-block-five-tips-to-help-you-stay-productive/), [writing about the project](https://nuffieldtechnologies.com/resources/blog/2024/05/09/overcome-coders-block), and outlining ideas.

The thing is, even though it is well known and there are [several articles](https://www.nealkhosla.com/blog/on-coders-block) outlining the effects and how to treat them, I have never once heard about it in my classes.

## Back to the Future!

I think that it is important to not only acknowledge the existence of mental blocks, but also naming them. I find as a person that is wordy, naming something gives it more power and significance. For a while I thought I was all in my head, but now since there are words for the feeling I am experiencing, I know that they are real.

The burnout I feel is real and tangible, and so is the block I have been experiencing for longer than I would have liked. Would I have been able to purposefully make a change without these terminology?

And now since I know what I am feeling, I can properly troubleshoot the problems. Which is, for me, changing my behavior and mindset.

Admitting that something is true does not make me less of a programmer, but rather stronger as I am acknowledging the problem. And, as a programmer, one of the skills we learn and are drilled on again and again is [problem solving and perseverance](https://www.computerscience.org/careers/computer-programmer/).

I don’t think this battle will be quick or short by any means, but I do hope that by bringing these terms to light that someone else will be able to find them and connect with them. I know that life is one big puzzle we will never truly begin to solve, but at least I can organize my pieces and try to figure out how to piece together my life. Or, at the very least, be able to help someone else get there instead.
