Thailand is known for the sunny beaches and tropical weather, but what about those temples?

One thing I did not realize was how religious of a people Thais are. But, I certainly noticed when every couple of city blocks, a beautiful temple is constructed. Some are fancier than others, but they all include gold, tall arches, and a serene vibe.

After being in Thailand for a few days, we could see how the ‘peaceful’ Thais really were, they drove fast, honked, and generally disobeyed some traffic laws. In person, the sweetest humans. On the road? Massachusetts looks tame.

In the temples, it was a different vibe.

The Occasion

The third of June is the current Queen’s birthday (Mrs Suthida Bajrasudhabimalalakshana according to Google). Since we had off work, my friends and I decided to wander to our local temple, right next to Ekkamai station, to pay our respects to Thai culture (and in this case the government).

The gate was grand, and had a symbol that we were told was the Queen’s. That made it an even better choice for visiting on that day. We walked in and noticed how everything was peaceful. No cars, motorbikes. Silence next to a bustling almost highway.

We approached the first building and noticed a few pairs of shoes before the steps. I remembered learning that shoes were a no in the temples, so we removed them and stepped onto the marble. It was solid, and surprisingly cold for such a warm day.

We walked up the steps and approached the main building. There was no AC so we noticed it was silent, except for the beating hum of a fan. There were a few women sitting, scattered, praying to the large Buddha shrine in the center.

The Buddha was big, taller than me just sitting, and was made of what appeared to be gold. He had a light that made him look ethereal. Below him were many smaller Buddhas, looking to be just as carefully crafted. On either side of the room, there was a shrine for the king and queen. They were not as large as the Buddha display, but just as beautiful, with fresh flowers, purple for the Queen, yellow for the king. We watched in awe before turning our attention to the chairs in the back.

The chairs appeared old, but well loved. They had little plaques, when translated were donor markings. There was a tip jar at the center of the room, right before the Buddha area, so the chairs were probably gifts from the community.

After sitting in the chairs thoughtfully for a moment, we started to head out when I noticed a stack of pamphlets. After translating the note on top, we learned that they were all being given away for free. Granted, they were prays from the 2021 Lunar New Year, so that made sense.

This was the first time I saw Thai writing up close, and so tangible. I remember tracing the letters of a script that seemed ever so slightly out of reach. The curves looped and the straight lines were stark. It was clearly computer generated, but the thoughtfulness in the calligraphy behind the original script was prominent.

We exited the building, feeling a sense of peace from the temple. Then, one of my friends got the idea to explore around the area. The rest of us were game.

We continued onwards to behind the temple to find another just as beautiful temple. I am still confused why the two of them are literally three meters apart, but decided not to argue with the fate of the world.

We took off our shoes once more, stepping onto the (warmer) marble. This one did not have as large of an outcropping, so the steps were exposed and I could feel the heat through my socks.

Inside the temple, once entering through glass doors, we noticed more Buddhas. There were three of the same size, large and beautiful, at the other end of the room. The one corner had a special display for the queen, with more purple flowers. I wish I could do both of these justice. To capture what I had seen is nothing words can describe, and any description I give is a pitiful attempt to explain true beauty. Everything, including my words, pales in comparison.

For example, each of the chairs were carefully carved. Thoughtfully so, like each one was meant to present to the Queen herself. The fabric cushions were beautifully interwoven with small strands of shiny gold thread, and it felt like I was looking into a beautiful garden instead of cloth.

After paying our respects to these Buddhas as well, one of the group noticed, out of the corner of their eye, a cat. There was a different door on the side of the temple than the one we entered, so we went over and noticed an orange and a black cat. They were both extremely cute, but that is when our attention was caught by a sign talking about a “collection room.”

The arrow on it pointed to this small marble staircase. My group shrugged, who were we to disobey the whim of cats?

We headed up the stairs, one step at a time. The spiral staircase was cold, a testament to the small outcropping the stairs were enveloped in. Traveling up, we noticed that region was plain, a stark difference to all of the fabulously decorated rooms before (even the ceilings had patterns and focal points).

Then we emerged onto the roof of the temple. Before, the marble was hot on the ground where the eaves failed to cover the ground, but on the roof this level had no covering at anypoint of the day, and it felt like hot coals. Each step was slight pain, but by walking fast enough it was barely noticeable.

We then wandered around the roof and had to go to the opposite side of the central chamber to find an open door to the “collections.” That room had the most Buddhas I have ever seen in my life. Some had different poses too, like the sculptures wanted to capture his beauty every way. It was stunning.

There was another donation box, but also a letter. After translating it, some of the larger Buddha was given as a gift to a Thai princess from India and a show of generosity and love toward Buddha. We thought it was magical to see two distinctly different countries united under the same religion, and using that religion to give, not take.

We looked around the room a bit more, but this was the first room without fans, and thus from being mostly windows and in the sun all day, it was hot and stuffy. We left the way we came, across the slightly too hot roof to the freezing cold spiral staircase.

We bid farewell to the cats before reentering the second temple and slipping out the main door and descending the stairs to grab our shoes.

We continued around the temple grounds, talking about what we saw, before coming to a little building hidden among trees. After a quick translation, we learned this was for Thai funerals. That explained all of the flowers and floral wreaths next to the sign.

That was the last building that we could see (that was not a school), so we started to walk back towards the main gate. On the way, we noticed another large golden Buddha. Except, funnily enough, someone spilled birdseed and there was a pack of pigeons around the Buddha. However, the Buddha was spotless, so it looked as if he was giving a sermon to the flock.

It was a sight to see.

Not just the pigeons, all of it. It made me realize that even if we do not consciously see it, religion is a major part of Thai’s lives. The people we say there praying showed me that even in silence, there is an enormous impact on your soul.

And another thing I learned is that what I think of culture, what this culture is, is not what I had in mind at all, and I am very excited to learn more over the next eight weeks here.
